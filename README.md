# About me...

I am a Software Engineer at Capgemini and a 2025 graduate from Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering. I work mainly with Java Spring Boot, MERN stack, Python, and C++. I like solving problems and enjoy working with others as part of a team.

I believe in "LEARN TO LEAD" and value empathy in the workplace. Outside of work, I like to read books.

Feel free to reach out to connect or talk about technology and books. - KLN
